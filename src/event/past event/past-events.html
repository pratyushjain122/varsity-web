                        V@rSITy Care made this post using the theme colors of world cancer day (orange and blue). The
                        main goal for the stories was to engage and educate people about cancer. It was a team effort in
                        collection of data which expressed the important points in a concise manner and design them to
                        be appealing to the eye. The quiz helped us to interact with the audience and the victim stories
                        helped us to show that there is a light at the end of this tunnel and spread positive mindset.

                        To pay tribute to our Martyred CRPF Jawans in Pulwama Attack, everyone wore black on the day,
                        assembled and wrote their feelings regarding the attack on Board near SIT Entrance. Roses were
                        kept and candles were lighted up in the memory of our Jawans.
