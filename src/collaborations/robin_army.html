            EVENT : Swachata Pledge with Kids<br><br>

            ORGANIZATION: Robin Hood Army<br><br>

            LOCATION: Symbiosis Institute of Technology<br><br>

            January 25, 2020 witnessed the visit of Robin Hood Academy’s students to Symbiosis Institute of Technology,
            in collaboration with V@rSITy-Care. Team V@rSITy invited the students to inculcate the zeal to pursue higher
            education in them. Team RHA arrived by 2:00pm and was welcomed with badges having the Indian flag printed on
            them. 44 students, along with 6 Robins and 25 V@rSITy-Care members, were made to take ‘Swachhata Pledge’ to
            maintain cleanliness around them. 6 groups, each consisting of 6-7 students, 2 V@rSITy members, and a Robin,
            were instructed on which sites must be covered during the tour of the college. The aim was to build
            excitement amongst the students by performing simple experiments like ‘Dispersion of white light’ in Physics
            Lab, explaining them the importance of oxygen in air through a simple ‘Candle Experiment’ in Chemistry Lab,
            making them aware of what the computers are used for, etc. 8 sites, including Workshop, Chemistry Lab,
            Physics Lab, Library, Computer Labs, Training and Placement Cell, Football Ground, and Mess were covered
            during the tour. Following this, everyone was instructed to meet in a classroom where each student was given
            a drawing sheet and colours and was asked to draw anything they liked. The whole atmosphere was full of
            life. After the drawing activity, the volunteers served the food to the students. Volunteers from Robin Hood
            Army gave a presentation on what RHA does and how. After this really informative presentation, everyone’s
            hand impressions were taken on white sheets as a commitment that everyone will work enthusiastically towards
            the betterment of these children and society, as a whole. With smiles on their faces and zeal in eyes ,the
            students, along with the Robins left for their homes. The Republic Day eve could not have been any better.
            In the end, we were successful in what we aimed at doing.
