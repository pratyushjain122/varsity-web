            <h3>WEBINAR 1 : DEALING WITH UNCERTAINTIES</h3>
            <p>
              DATE: 13 June, 2020 ORGANIZATION: ABHYUDAY , The Social body of IIT Bombay LOCATION: Virtual On 13th June
              2020, a webinar on MENTAL HEALTH-“Dealing With Uncertainties’’ was held to create awareness and positivity
              among people during the tough time everyone is going through. Instagram, Facebook and Whatsapp were used
              as an online platform to inform people about the webinar. We collaborated for the same with the drama club
              of college –M.O.S.A.I.C and ABHYUDAY ,The Social body of IIT Bombay. Various promotional events were
              planned for the same. First one was the doodle-art competition ‘DOODLIE-DOO’ in which the participants
              were asked to draw doodles on the topic- Moods, Mind and Mental Health and were featured on the club’s
              Instagram page. Around 30 people participated in it and the winners were declared after the webinar. A
              video, prepared by M.O.S.A.I.C, the drama club of SIT, was shared on Instagram on how mental is being
              affected during the lockdown. Another event was- any phase in life which they want to talk about and last
              was the one in which ten simple questions with options ‘YES’ or ‘NO’ were asked on the club’s page. Around
              90-100 peoples joined on the day of webinar. The webinar included three panelists who discussed about
              various issues and how to tackle all the stressful thoughts- Dr. Anuradha Harkare, Founder, Mind Catalyst
              Study Counselling. She talked about how right now people’s minds are full of various uncertainties and the
              importance to deal with it. She further discussed how difficult it is for students to adapt to a complete
              new process of learning, how pattern of exams has changed, and how this all has affected final year
              students the most. Ms. Anushree Lokhande, Founder, Evolving together. She discussed about how one need to
              manage emotions and thoughts. Emotions become intense as one try to ignore them, bury them or misidentify
              them. The topics that were covered were motional awareness, management of emotions, link between thoughts
              and emotions, mood boosters, etc. Dr. Girija Mahale, Head, Symbiosis Centre of Emotional Well Being. She
              talked about how people need to convert challenges into opportunities and how one need to think out of the
              box and try things not done before. She also talked about self care and other things like- physical
              activity, sleep hygiene, etc. Ms. Mayuri Dutta was the guest speaker and she talked about mindfulness,
              take things as it comes to us. She further explained how every problem is an opportunity and the need to
              take care in the present scenario. At the end of the webinar a question and answer session was held where
              the participants got a chance to interact and discuss their issues with the three exceptional panelists
              The webinar made everyone understand that even though the life is full of uncertainties, important thing
              is that one must look for positive aspects and adapt to the changes to lead a stress free life.
