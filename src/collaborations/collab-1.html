              Our first Panelist, Dr Girija Mahale, Head, Symbiosis Centre For Emotional Well being ,mainly talked about
              how sadness and depression are two different things. She explained that how everyone is sad but not
              everyone is depressed. She talked about various symptoms like inability to enjoy things, difficult to
              concentrate, etc. and possible causes of depression in different age group of people.

            <p>
              Dr. Anushree Lokhande, Founder, Evolving Together spoke about how to be a good support and how to get
              help. She explained the three types of boundaries- porous, healthy and rigid. One needs to manage emotions
              and practice mindfulness to be happy. She also explained whom and when to approach someone for help.
            </p>
            <p>
              Dr. Anurag, HOD of Psychiatry, MIMS Hyderabad talked about stigma around mental health issues and the need
              of proper medication. He explained that how 1 in 6 people suffer from neuropsychiatric disease but many
              don’t come forward to talk about it because of society which often results in them committing suicides. He
              explained various steps to prevent suicide such as establish communication, seek professional help and
              listen more than giving advice.
            </p>
            <p>
              At the end of the session there was a Q&A session held where the people got a chance to interact and ask
              their questions to the three exceptional panelists. The webinar made everyone understand that rather than
              being judgmental, people should be more compassionate towards the one who are facing such problems so that
              they can talk more openly about it without being afraid of any stigma.
