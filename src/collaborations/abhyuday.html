            On 8th August 2020, a webinar on COMBATING THE ENEMY WITHIN: DEPRESSION was held, by V@rsity Care in
            collaboration with Abhyuday, The Social body of IIT Bombay, to create awareness among people. Instagram,
            LinkedIn, Facebook and Whatsapp were used as an online platform to inform people about the webinar. To reach
            out to more people we contacted several promotional websites like Scoopit, Digg, Webinarkhoj and instagram
            pages that already speaks about such topic like mentalhealthsupport.__, toyourlife and admirebrainy.<br><br>

            Various promotional events were planned for the same.First one was the writing competition for which the
            theme was ‘Lost in Myself, Moods and Depression’. The participants were asked to submit their work directly
            to the club’s instagram handle and those write-ups were anonymously uploaded for voting. The one with
            maximum votes was chosen as winner. A dance video, depicting internal feelings and moods, prepared by
            members of the club, was shared on Instagram. Another event was “MUSIC FOR THE SOUL” in which there was a
            live performance on the club’s instagram handle with KALA JOWSH, Musical Band of SIT. A short movie was made
            to depict that how there is sudden disinterest and loss of energy in one’s life because of depression.
            Around 85 people attended the webinar including three panelists who talked about what is depression, how to
            tackle it etc. The webinar included three panelists who discussed about various issues and how to tackle all
            the stressful thoughts-<br><br>

            Our first Panelist, Dr Girija Mahale, Head, Symbiosis Centre For Emotional Well being ,mainly talked about
            how sadness and depression are two different things. She explained that how everyone is sad but not everyone
            is depressed. She talked about various symptoms like inability to enjoy things, difficult to concentrate,
            etc. and possible causes of depression in different age group of people.<br><br>

            Dr. Anushree Lokhande, Founder, Evolving Together spoke about how to be a good support and how to get help.
            She explained the three types of boundaries- porous, healthy and rigid. One needs to manage emotions and
            practice mindfulness to be happy. She also explained whom and when to approach someone for help.<br><br>

            Dr. Anurag, HOD of Psychiatry, MIMS Hyderabad talked about stigma around mental health issues and the need
            of proper medication. He explained that how 1 in 6 people suffer from neuropsychiatric disease but many
            don’t come forward to talk about it because of society which often results in them committing suicides. He
            explained various steps to prevent suicide such as establish communication, seek professional help and
            listen more than giving advice.<br><br><br>

            At the end of the session there was a Q&A session held where the people got a chance to interact and ask
            their questions to the three exceptional panelists. The webinar made everyone understand that rather than
            being judgmental, people should be more compassionate towards the one who are facing such problems so that
            they can talk more openly about it without being afraid of any stigma.
